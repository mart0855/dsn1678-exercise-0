	<p>55 to 65 days are needed from germination to harvest of the root.</p>
	<p>The usually deep purple roots of <strong>beetroot</strong> are eaten either grilled, boiled, or roasted as a
	cooked vegetable, cold as a salad after cooking and adding oil and vinegar, or raw and
	shredded, either alone or combined with any salad vegetable.</p>
	<blockquote>Fact, bears eat beets. Bears, beets, “Battlestar Galactica.”
	<cite>— Jim Halpert</cite></blockquote>
	<blockquote>I have some <em>weird</em> habits. For instance, <strong>I love beets</strong>. Show me a salad bar and I will
	clean them out of their beets.
